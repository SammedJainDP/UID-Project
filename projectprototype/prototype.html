    <h2>Prototype Briefing</h2> 
<h3>Landing page</h3> 
<p>The landing page prominently displays the website name, 'Volunteer Wave,' 
    in the header section, establishing the platform's identity.
     The login button on this page successfully directs users to the 
     designated login page, facilitating easy access for registered users. 
     The signup button seamlessly guides new users to the signup page. 
    These functionalities ensure clear navigation paths for both existing and new users.</p>
<h3>Login page</h3> 
<p>The login button and the 'Forgot password?' feature are both operational. 
    Initiating the login button seamlessly redirects users to the website's home page, 
    facilitating quick access upon authentication. Similarly, selecting 'Forgot password?' 
    navigates users to the reset password page, allowing for password recovery. Clicking the close 'X' 
    button redirects users to the landing page. Clicking on 'new user? sign up' efficiently directs 
    users to the signup page for registration. Presently, the user ID and password input fields are 
    inactive for logging in but are slated for activation and 
    full functionality in the upcoming implementation phase.</p>
<h3>Sign up page</h3> 
<p> The signup button functions effectively. 
    The signup button leads the users to the login page. 
    This page includes fields for first name, last name, username, email, 
    password, and password confirmation, ensuring a comprehensive signup process. 
    However, similar to the login page, the input fields for username, email, password, 
    and confirmation are currently inactive. These fields are slated for activation and 
    full functionality in the upcoming implementation phase. 
    Meanwhile, the close 'X' button smoothly redirects users back to the landing page. </p>
<h3>Reset Password page</h3> 
<p>The functionality of the save button on the reset password page is robust, effectively 
    initiating the reset operation. Upon pressing the save button, a prompt displays a success 
    message confirming the reset operation. Subsequently clicking 'OK' within the prompt seamlessly 
    navigates users back to the login page. Meanwhile, on this page, the input fields designated for 
    user ID, new password, and password re-entry are currently inactive. These fields are scheduled for 
    activation and full functionality in the upcoming implementation phase. 
    The close 'X' button directs users back to the login page, ensuring consistent navigation.</p>
<h3>Home page </h3>
<p>The home button efficiently directs users to the home page of the website, 
    serving as a central navigation point. Presently, the search bar lacks input 
    functionality, although the framework for search operations has been implemented. 
    While clicking on the search bar, it currently displays direct search results without user input. 
    The filter option, presented as a dropdown menu, currently offers placeholder options and a non-functional
     apply button. Moreover, the post button leads users to the 'Create Volunteer Opportunity' page to initiate
      opportunity listings. The profile button features a dropdown menu showcasing options like 'View Profile,' 
      'Edit Profile,' 'My Events,' 'My Posts,' and 'Logout.' <br><br>
    The home page exhibits a list of available volunteer opportunities, each accompanied by brief information. 
    Presently, seven opportunities are displayed, yet only four are clickable. Selecting an opportunity from the 
    list leads users to a detailed page specific to that opportunity, offering a comprehensive description. 
    On this page, pressing the 'Register' button triggers a confirmation prompt. Opting 'Confirm' within the prompt 
    seamlessly redirects users back to the home page, completing the registration process for the selected opportunity.
    </p>
<h3>View profile </h3>
<p>The 'View Profile' button within the header leads users to the dedicated 'View Profile' page where 
    detailed user information is displayed.
     On this page, both the 'OK' button and the 'X' button are functional, providing clear navigation
      options back to the home page.</p> 
<h3>Edit profile </h3>
<p>The 'Edit Profile' button directs users to the 'Edit Profile' page, which currently presents 
    input fields for first name, last name, username, email, age, preferences, and location. However, 
    these fields do not accept input at the moment. When users attempt to save changes by clicking the 
    save button, a prompt displays a success message confirming the edit operation. 
    Subsequently clicking 'OK' within the prompt seamlessly navigates users back to the home page.</p>
<h3>Create volunteer opportunity page</h3> 
<p>This page facilitates the creation of a Volunteer Opportunity post. 
    Currently, the initial date field has a restricted dropdown, allowing only the selection of a 
    day in November 2023. Although the chosen date doesn't appear in the field, a comprehensive date dropdown 
    will be introduced in the next update. <br><br>
    The time field includes dropdowns for start and end times, with hours and minutes. While the selected time
     doesn't currently display in the field, this will be resolved in the upcoming implementation. The "Add New
      Time Slot" button allows the addition of another time slot, but the current version only accommodates two 
      time slots. This limitation will be addressed in the upcoming update. <br><br>
    The radio button fields for Teaching and Physical Requirements function properly. Regarding the other fields, 
    which are currently empty text boxes, they currently don't accept input. However, this will be fixed in the upcoming 
    implementation.
    The 'X' and 'Cancel' buttons redirect to the home page, while the 'Post' button confirms the successful posting of 
    the volunteer opportunity.
    </p>
<h3>My events </h3>
<p>The My events button leads to my events page. The "My Events" page currently shows only one registered event, 
    regardless of the number of events you have registered for. Clicking on the displayed event directs you to its description.
     The "Cancel Registration" button, situated at the bottom right, functions properly, enabling the cancellation of the selected 
     registration. However, upon revisiting the "My Events" section, it inaccurately persists in displaying the previously registered
      event. 
    This issue is slated for resolution in the upcoming updates.</p> 
<h3>My posts</h3> 
<p>The "My Posts" page currently displays only one event, even if the user has created multiple events, 
    which is a limitation that will be addressed in future updates. Two options are available at the bottom right: 
    "Edit" and "Delete." Clicking on "Edit" redirects you to a page where you can modify the content of the posted event. 
    Although the page has a "Save" button, the fields cannot be altered at this time. The 'X' button on this page returns you to the
     "My Posts" page.<br><br>

    The "Delete" option, when selected, prompts a confirmation popup. Clicking 'Confirm' deletes the post, while selecting 
    'Cancel' or clicking 'X' returns you to the "My Posts" page. However, currently, even after deleting a post, returning 
    to the "My Posts" page still displays one post. This issue is slated for resolution in the upcoming updates.
    </p>
<h3>Logout</h3> 
<p>The 'Logout' button, when selected, will promptly direct users back to the landing page of the website,
     completing the logout process.
