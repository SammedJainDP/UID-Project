    <h3>Problem Statement </h3>
    <p>People often possess the desire and potential to contribute to their communities and causes they care about through
        volunteering. However, they often face the challenge of finding suitable volunteer opportunities that align with their interests,
        schedules, and skills. To address this issue, we aim to create a user-friendly web application tailored specifically for users
         who like selfless volunteering. The interface shall enable the user to discover and engage in the event while
         fostering a sense of community and personal growth.</p>
    <h3>User Goals</h3>
    <p>
       <span>Finding Suitable Volunteering Opportunities:</span>&emsp;Users identify volunteering opportunities that align with their interests, skills, and availability.

        <br /><span>Post Oppurtunities:</span>&emsp; Users will post voluteering options.
       
    </p>
    <h3>Obstacles</h3>
    <p>
        Making a single interface for both, the users wishing to volunteer and, the users willing to provide oppurtunities by posting details of the event. <br>
        Balancing and prioritizing user experience, enjoyable designs, intuitive functionalities and user goals without compromising on each other.
