        <h3>Problem Statement </h3>
        <p>"People often possess the desire and potential to contribute to their communities and causes they care about through
            volunteering. However, they often face challenges in finding suitable volunteer opportunities that align with their interests,
            schedules, and skills. Additionally, tracking their volunteering hours and the impact of their efforts can be cumbersome and lacks
            a cohesive platform. To address these issues, we aim to create a user-friendly mobile application tailored specifically for users who like selfless volunteering, enabling them to easily discover, engage in, and document their volunteer activities while fostering a sense of community
